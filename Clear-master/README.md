# Team 17 - Project Khronos - User Interface Development 
## Use of Clear - LWJGL Extened Library uses JOML 
Clear is a wrapper for LWJGL3 that makes it simple to build basic programs that require a user-interface. The windowing and UI wrappers are separated into two projects in case you want to use one and not the other. The goal of the project is to provide a very sound foundation for creating custom user-interfaces that aren't limited by foundational design decisions (such as forcing certain layout types to be used, or so on). This is for GUI creators who want something "free-form" to build their interfaces in.

## General Features
- Heavily customizable: focus on user extendability
- High performance: system performance was kept in mind when creating the system, and as far as I know, it doesn't have any sort of resources leak or the like. Tools are provided to help keep resource management sweet and simple.
- Documentation: the project has carefully been documented with numerous comments so far to allow users to quickly learn how to begin adding their own functionality to the base systems
- Detailed Examples: demo programs are included that will show users how to use all of the currently implemented systems. The default LWJGL3 NanoVG demos are included as well for additional support options.
